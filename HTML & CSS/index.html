				<i>Related Information</i>
				While many companies take great pains to reduce the costs of raw materials, labor, overhead and transportation, they often overlook the millions of ringgit in customs duties and taxes that erode profits. More often than not, companies spend considerably more unnecessary money on customs duties / GST than they should. It is vital for importers, exporters and the overall trade community to realize that customs duties and GST are not fixed costs and can, in fact, be lawfully minimized with proper research, planning, structuring and guided planning by experience personnel.
			</p>
			<p>
				The GST an indirect tax,is a broad based consumption tax which replaced the Sales and Service Tax in Malaysia effective 01 April 2014. GST covers all supply chains in the economy such as manufacturing, distribution and retailing. Almost all supplies in the manufacturing sector will be subject to GST including sale of finished goods, stocks, capital assets and services rendered to other establishments. To ensure GST compliance for your business, a coordinated effort by all key business units within the business organization is essential as this cross-functional issue may affect the entire business structure. All business owners and all unit managers must be aware of the implications and effects of GST on their business as well as their responsibilities in the GST implementation. It is of utmost importance that all parties understand the impact of GST to the business and it involves more than just the Finance Department.
